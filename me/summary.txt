Personal Background
Name: Ganesh Neelakanta
Education: Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)
Institution: CVR College of Engineering, Hyderabad
EAMCET Rank: 15,173
Educational Journey and Early Decisions
The College Selection Dilemma
Despite achieving an EAMCET rank of 15,173, which could have secured admission to Tier 
1 or Tier 2 colleges in Hyderabad, I faced a significant challenge. My parents, concerned 
about our financial situation, suggested studying at a Tier 3 college in our hometown. 
However, I understood that this decision could significantly impact my future career 
prospects.
Strategic Decision Making
After extensive research, I prepared a list of the top 10 colleges in Hyderabad. During the 
web option phase, I initially secured admission to CMR College for Computer Science 
Engineering (CSE), which aligned with my interests. However, my sister's advice proved 
pivotal: "If you choose ECE, you can pursue both government jobs and software careers, 
which isn't possible with CSE. Additionally, many girls choose CSE, and as a young man, 
you should consider ECE."
Ultimately, I chose CVR College for ECE, ranking it 10th in my preference list. I was 
admitted to one of the top 4 colleges in Hyderabad in 2019, though I initially felt 
disappointed about the ECE stream choice.
Financial Reality Check
Foot Locker - Internal Use Only
A crucial learning moment came when I discovered the fee structure. Students with ranks 
below 10,000 received complete tuition fee waivers, while I had to pay ₹126,000 annually. 
The difference between rank 10,000 and 15,000 was merely 4 marks, which made me 
realize the importance of every point in competitive examinations.
Academic Challenges and Growth
Early College Experience
As an electronics student, I was naturally drawn to innovation and hands-on technology. I 
preferred tangible, practical applications over abstract concepts like Data Structures and 
Algorithms (DSA), which initially made coding less appealing to me.
Impact of COVID-19
The pandemic significantly disrupted my college experience, affecting nearly two years of 
my BTech journey. When I returned to campus in my third year, I found myself at a 
crossroads with multiple career paths:
• Core ECE engineering roles
• Government positions
• Software development
• Entrepreneurship
• Higher studies
Personal Challenges and Growth
During this period, I struggled with a tendency to avoid asking questions due to fear of 
judgment. I preferred finding solutions independently, assuming others might laugh at my 
queries. This realization came too late, but it taught me valuable lessons about seeking 
help and collaboration.
Career Preparation and Placement Journey
The Pressure to Conform
Family pressure and societal expectations pushed me toward software engineering roles, 
despite my initial interests lying elsewhere. With accumulated educational debt of ₹6-8 
lakhs, I felt compelled to prioritize immediate employment over long-term passion.
Foot Locker - Internal Use Only
Placement Challenges
Initial Struggles
• Limited ECE Opportunities: Only 1 out of 40 companies visiting our college 
recruited for ECE-specific roles
• Coding Challenges: Competing with CSE students who had stronger programming 
foundations
• Multiple Failures: Despite clearing aptitude and reasoning rounds, I consistently 
failed coding assessments
Discovery of Unfair Practices
I learned that many students were using unfair means during online coding tests and 
aptitude assessments, which motivated me to focus on legitimate skill development.
Communication Skills Development
After improving my coding abilities, I faced new challenges in group discussions and 
interviews. I addressed this by:
• Using mobile applications to practice English conversation with strangers from 
different states
• Actively seeking feedback from interviewers after each session
• Systematically working on identified weaknesses
Professional Offers and Decision Making
Multiple Opportunities
By October 2023, I had secured several offers:
1. DXC Company: ₹4.2 LPA CTC
2. TCS Ninja: ₹3.36 LPA (off-campus)
3. Anblicks: Cloud Data Engineering role with 6-month internship
4. L&T: Embedded Engineer position, ₹4.5 LPA
Strategic Choice: Anblicks
Despite having multiple options, I chose Anblicks based on industry advice about data 
science being a booming field. The role offered:
• 6-month internship with ₹5,000 monthly stipend
• Performance-based salary determination (₹4.5-6 lakhs range)
• Comprehensive training valued at ₹2-3 lakhs

However, this decision came with significant contractual obligations:
• 2-year commitment to the company
• ₹1 lakh penalty to college for early termination
• ₹1 lakh penalty to Anblicks for contract breach
Internship Experience at Anblicks
